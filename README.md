A single-page web tool to convert between metric and imperial recipes.

To use, type or copy and paste a recipe into the "Original recipe" field, select the proper conversion method, and click "Convert". The the output will appear in the second text area with updated units. Currently, supported methods include imperial to metric, metric to imperial, and metric to imperial volumes. 

The project is powered primarily by regular expressions, and it can convert most imperial measurements to mass and/or liquid volume metric units, and vice versa. It recognizes a variety of the most common cooking liquids and dry goods, and that functionality can be updated to include more ingredients. If an ingredient isn't recognized as a special category (dry good or liquid), it will be translated based on weight or left as is, in the case of an unknown volume measurement.
