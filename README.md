A single-page web tool to convert between metric and imperial recipes.

To use, type or copy and paste a recipe into the "Original recipe" field, select the proper conversion method, and click "Convert". The the output will appear in the second text area with updated units. Currently, only imperial to metric is supported, but metric to imperial will be added.

The project is powered primarily by regular expressions, and it can convert most imperial volume measurements to mass and/or liquid volume metric units. It can parse a variety of common cooking liquids and dry goods, and that functionality can be updated to include more ingredients.
